								<h1>Galaxy simulation</h1>
								<h3>Physics simulation of the movement of stars in a galaxy and simulations of galaxy collisions. Coded in Python.</h3>

								<p>For my <i>Numerical Models in Physics</i> class, I had to program a galaxy simulation in Python using fourth order Runge-Kutta methods
									to integrate the differential equations of motion of the stars inside the galaxy.
									The goal was to determine dark matter paramaters that could achieve a stable galaxy with rotation curves (angular velocity
									of the starts versus their distance from the center of the galaxy) resembling those of real galaxies. Since there are a lot
									of stars in a galactic formation, we had to find ways to make our code more efficient; for instance, we divided our simulation space
									in a grid where we would compute the average mass, and use this grid to compute the potential (instead of simply
									computing the potential on every star caused by every other star). We would also compute the potential
									once every few frames instead of every frame since the potential calculations were quite heavy.
								</p>

									As every project in that class, we could gain more points by exploring other ideas. Since I was really motivated by
									this project, I decided I would experiment with galaxy collisions. However, I wasn't completely satisfied.
									Until that point, all the simulations were computed on a 2 dimensional plane, since galaxies are mostly flat; however, I felt
									this was not correct, so I added a third dimension to the simulations and added some variability in this new direction;
									I wanted to see if the galaxy would still form again a disk, which it did. I also wanted to see a simulation
									of two galaxies colliding. Although it completely busted my laptop's memory, it still gave some pretty neat results:
