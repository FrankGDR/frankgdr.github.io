								<h1>Solar System</h1>
								<h3>A simple and accurate Solar System with physics-based keplerian orbits and double precision positions for the planets and moons, all made in Unity.</h3>
								
								<p>
									My favorite genre is by far science fiction, which is why I wanted to make a space game. While reading
									James S. A. Corey's books from the Expanse serie, I had the idea to create a game taking place in the Solar System,
									where you could set up colonies on moons, mine asteroids and control complete fleets of spaceships. Since I study physics,
									I also wanted to make sure that the physics behind the motion of planets and moons in the system 
									was physically realistic. Due to a lack of free time, I've never really had time to implement the game's mechanics; however,
									I was able to create a realistic representation of the Solar System with true keplerian orbits.
								</p>

								<p>
									For starters, I went back into my old files to look for a project I made during my <i>Numerical Physics</i> introduction
									course from my first university semester in which we computed planet orbits from real keplerian parameters such as
									excentricity, mean anomaly, inclination, etc. With that, I could get any planet position with only its orbit parameters
									and a time value. I found every planet's orbital properties on <i>NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive</i>'s website.
								</p>

								<p>
									Of course, knowing that the Solar System is incredibly big compared to planetary systems, I knew I had to compute the planets
									and moons' positions with double precision. I made a custom double precision Transform class to help compute the positions of all 
									astronomical bodies. However, Unity's game space only works with built-in float Transform. I had to find a way to transpose
									my double positions into floats. Of course, simply transposing my values inside Unity's space with scaling didn't work; if my
									system was too big, the far away planets would jitter, and if it was too small, the moons wouldn't have enough precision and would
									jitter. Until then, I was keeping my Solar System static and moving my camera from planet to planet. The simple fix I found
									was to instead move the Solar System and keep the camera in place. That way, the focus of the camera was always
									on the origin of the 3D space, where I could benefit from the maximum floating point precision.
